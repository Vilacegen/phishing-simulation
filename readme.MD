# Instagram Phishing Attack Simulation

## Overview

This project simulates a phishing attack using a fake Instagram login page and a QR code. The goal is to demonstrate the potential risks of phishing attacks and highlight how easily a user could fall victim to such an attack, especially when scanning unknown QR codes or clicking untrusted links.

The demonstration is conducted **ethically** for educational purposes, helping to identify vulnerabilities and promote **cybersecurity awareness**.

## Key Lessons Learned

- **Don‚Äôt scan unknown QR codes**: A simple scan of an unknown QR code can lead to malicious websites that steal sensitive information, such as usernames and passwords.
- **Verify URL**: Always double-check the URL, especially if you receive links via untrusted sources. Even when a site looks legitimate, it might be fake.
- **The importance of cybersecurity**: Understanding how these attacks work empowers users to stay protected. Knowing how attackers operate can help defend against real-world threats.
